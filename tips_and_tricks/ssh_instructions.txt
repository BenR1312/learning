Basic How to ssh for server debugging / patching / editing.

  To ssh into a server we can follow these basic instructions to get the right info
  for where to go.

  1. go to to the Capfile in an app to find the information for the different environments.
    eg: staging details might look like this
      stage :staging do
        server 'railsvr1.blah.net.au', :app, :db, :web, primary: true
        set    :domain, 'staging.testing_blah.org.au'
        set    :core_name, "staging"
        set    :group, 'developers'
      end

  2. then we can use the server information to ssh into the server.
     we use ubuntu for hosting our servers?
    eg: ssh ubuntu@railsvr1.blah.net.au

    this gets us onto the server for staging our apps.

  3. Currently we dont have access to the right info or the right environment
     to get the vhosts for the servers themselves we do
     - cd /var/vhosts/staging.testing_blah.org.au

  4. This gets us to the environment for testing_blah staging.
    from here we can ls to see the current environment, the releases
    which will contain the current release and the previous release.
    there is also a shared folder which contains information important to everything that
    wont really change. mostly .yml files.

  5. From here we cd into the relevant file, eg.
     - cd current
     This gets us to the current version and we can now start investigating either.
     Problems in individual files, eg, we can cd into app/models and change or copy a model

  6. The more common one to look at is, how to get into a console window to start
     querying the database.
     ensure the pathname looks something like this.
     - ubuntu@railsvr1:/var/vhosts/staging.testing_blah.org.au/current

     then we can run - rails c staging
     its important to note that we need to specify the environment as
     - rails c
     wont work and will give a wonky error message.

  Notes for debugging:
    Other options we have available are to head in and find a file, and open it up
    with vi and edit it live on the server.

    eg from the current directory we can then, cd app/models/ to visit.
    or, we can do vi app/models/user.rb to get to the user.rb file and open it in vi
    for editing.

    another important tool is scp ( scp -- secure copy (remote file copy program) )
    this is for when we want to copy a file from a location and put it somewhere else,
    like if we wanted to copy a file from staging / prod and fuck around with it on the desktop.

    scp ubuntu@railsvr1:/var/vhosts/staging.testing_blah.org.au/current/app/models/user.rb ~/Desktop/ben.rb

    the above line will take the user.rb file from the staging server, then it will be
    copied and places on the desktop where its renamed to ben.rb

    important part to note is from the home direction we want to get the desktop.
    ~/ is the home directory, and ~/Desktop will be our desktop.
